## Liquid

This is the beginning of a Common Lisp project created to simulate and implement a P2P
networking system based on a distributed graph database.  The project was
abandoned to make way for Plasma, which implements the full vision in Clojure,
but I'm keeping this around for posterity, to remember the common lisp days :-).

Go checkout [Plasma](http://github.com/rosejn/plasma).
